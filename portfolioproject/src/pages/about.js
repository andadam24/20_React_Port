        Hello, my name is Adam Andrzejczak. I graduated from Michigan State University in 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Finance. I have been working full-time since and thought that coding would be an interesting skill to learn. I stumbled upon the MSU Bootcamp and thought this would be a great way to learn. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and my contact information is below if you'd like to connect.
